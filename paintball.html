                All of the themed Community episodes are great, but this one is the best. The Ken Burns documentary style adds drama and tension, as well as plenty of hilarious moments. The war between The United Forts of Pillowtown and the Legit Republic of Blanketsburg help the audience understand just how important Abed and Troy are to each other and the rest of the study group. It’s a great episode that you should definitely watch!

                Jeff Winger is the primary protagonist of Community. He brings the study group together in the first episode and always keeps them together when times get tough. He is incredibly charismatic, and thus, extremely popular in Greendale Community College. Despite his confident exterior, Jeff is plagued by many insecurities, especially when it comes to his relationship with his father. This self-doubt causes him to always push himself to be perfect. The positive impacts of that are that he is always willing to step up when needed (as can be seen in his iconic inspirational speeches). On the flip side, whenever things arenâ€™t going his way, his need to be perfect leads to him self-destructing (demonstrated by his relationship with Rich and the lack of effort he puts in classes in Greendale).

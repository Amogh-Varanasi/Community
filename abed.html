                Abed Nadir is not the main protagonist of Community, that title belongs to Jeff Winger, but he is by far the most unique and perhaps the most important character of all. Abed has an extensive knowledge of films and tv shows. Some of his favorites include Inspector Spacetime and Cougar Town. He uses this interest in tv to relate to those around him through constant references. In addition to allowing Abed to relate to his peers in unique ways, the constant references pave the way for the meta jokes that make Community what it is. He often announces the season of the show to the study group when discussing prior events. Finally, Abed’s meta jokes make way for the perfect conclusion to Community: 30 minutes of exploring what future seasons show would look like and why they wouldn’t work.
